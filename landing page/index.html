                    <h2 class="title">Autumn <span>Season</span></h2>
                    <p>autumn, season of the year between summer and winter during which temperatures gradually decrease.
                         It is often called fall in the United States because leaves fall from the trees at that time.
                        Autumn is usually defined in the Northern Hemisphere as the period between the autumnal equinox (day and night equal in length), 
                        September 22 or 23, and the winter solstice (yearâ€™s shortest day), December 21 or 22;
                        and in the Southern Hemisphere as the period between March 20 or 21 and June 21 or 22.

                    <h2 class="title">Winter <span>Season</span></h2>
                    <p>Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates. It occurs after autumn and before spring. 
                      The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun.
                       Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.

                    <h2 class="title">Summer <span>Season</span></h2>
                    <p>Summer is traditionally associated with hot or warm weather. In Mediterranean climates, 
                      it is also associated with dry weather, while in other places (particularly in Eastern Asia because of the monsoon) 
                      it is associated with rainy weather. The wet season is the main period of vegetation growth within the savanna climate regime.
                       Where the wet season is associated with a seasonal shift in the prevailing winds, it is known as a monsoon

                    <h2 class="title">Spring <span>Season</span></h2>
                    <p>Spring and "springtime" refer to the season, and also to ideas of rebirth, rejuvenation, renewal, resurrection and regrowth. 
                      Subtropical and tropical areas have climates better described in terms of other seasons, e.g. dry or wet, monsoonal or cyclonic.
                       Cultures may have local names for seasons which have little equivalence to the terms originating in Europe.
